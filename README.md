Magic Feather: Replumed is a continuation of the [Magic Feather](https://github.com/ephys/minecraft-magic-feather) mod by [Ephys](https://github.com/ephys) for versions 1.19+

It adds not only the Magic Feather, granting unlimited creative flight within the range of a vanilla beacon, but also three other feather types.

## Features

### Magic Feather ![magicfeather](https://github.com/sudolev/MagicFeatherReplumed/assets/61996958/ddc4aedc-cc90-4436-a448-e2e7e5d6b037)

Classic balanced alternative to the Extra Utilities Angel Ring, granting the bearer creative flight within the range of any beacon.

### Arcane Feather ![arcanefeather](https://github.com/sudolev/MagicFeatherReplumed/assets/61996958/614a4804-72f4-4e6d-83ce-55c02dfb57a8)

Unlimited creative flight with no caveats. Unobtainable in survival by default, but configurable.

### Primeval Feather ![primevalfeather](https://github.com/sudolev/MagicFeatherReplumed/assets/61996958/4f6db06a-1250-4ac0-a072-8ad1653813e1)


Like the Arcane Feather, but with durability that ticks down while flying.

### Stygian Feather ![stygianfeather](https://github.com/sudolev/MagicFeatherReplumed/assets/61996958/ff31f826-aed9-47af-bbb0-8fd744a2cabe)


Like the Arcane Feather, but inflicts a constant wither effect on the user while flying.
