Magic Feather: Replumed is a continuation of the [Magic Feather](https://github.com/ephys/minecraft-magic-feather) mod by [Ephys](https://github.com/ephys) for versions 1.19+

It adds not only the Magic Feather, granting unlimited creative flight within the range of a vanilla beacon, but also two new feather types.

## Features

### Magic Feather

Classic balanced alternative to the Extra Utilities Angel Ring, granting the bearer creative flight within the range of any beacon.

### Arcane Feather

Unlimited creative flight with no caveats. Unobtainablle in survival by default, but configurable.

### Primeval Feather

Like the Arcane Feather, but with durability. Unobtainablle in survival by default, but configurable.
